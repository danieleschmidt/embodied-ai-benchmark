# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status
Template

## Context
We need a standard format for documenting architectural decisions to ensure consistency and traceability of design choices throughout the project lifecycle.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. Each ADR will follow this template structure:

### ADR Format:
- **Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
- **Context**: The situation that necessitates a decision
- **Decision**: The chosen solution
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes

### Naming Convention:
- Files: `XXXX-descriptive-title.md` where XXXX is a sequential number
- Location: `docs/adr/` directory

### Review Process:
1. Create ADR as "Proposed"
2. Team review and discussion
3. Mark as "Accepted" after consensus
4. Update status if later superseded

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Consistent documentation of architectural decisions
- Improved team communication and knowledge sharing
- Historical context for future maintenance
- Easier onboarding for new team members

### Negative:
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Requires discipline to maintain up-to-date records
